What you do understand is that the metal seems to have been disturbed pretty recently, based on dust patterns, and that there are traces of BLOOD on some of the metal.

THe ENGINEER agrees to come quietly, and you arrest them and put them in a makeshift holding cell (a STORAGE CLOSET) until you reach the nearest base.
